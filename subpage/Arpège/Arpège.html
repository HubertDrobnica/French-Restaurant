      <p>Mirazur is a modern interpretation of classic French cuisine based on seasonal products from the Mediterranean. Her menu also includes fruit, vegetables and herbs from vegetable gardens for the needs of the restaurant. In his speech at the gala, Mauro Colagreco established values ​​in the foundations of modern France: brotherhood, freedom and equality. He emphasized that his restaurant is built by people from different countries, and the kitchen itself is something that knows no borders. He admitted that it was in France that he found his home and the opportunity, the author: realize his dream. At a press conference after the gala, Colagreco recalled that 13 years ago he founded Mirazur, took advantage of the help of two people in the kitchen and two services. Today it is made up of a 50-member team or, as he says, a family.
